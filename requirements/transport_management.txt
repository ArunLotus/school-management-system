To manage the transportation aspect of a school management system, you will need a database with specific tables and fields to store information related to school bus scheduling, route management, bus attendance, and bus locations. Here's an example of the tables and their associated fields you might need:

1. **Bus Routes Table**:
   - `RouteID` (Primary Key)
   - `RouteName`
   - `Stops` (a list of stops on the route, potentially as an array or separate table)

2. **Bus Stops Table**:
   - `StopID` (Primary Key)
   - `StopName`
   - `Latitude`
   - `Longitude`

3. **Bus Schedule Table**:
   - `ScheduleID` (Primary Key)
   - `RouteID` (Foreign Key referencing Bus Routes)
   - `DayOfWeek` (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
   - `DepartureTime`

4. **School Buses Table**:
   - `BusID` (Primary Key)
   - `BusNumber`
   - `Capacity`
   - `DriverName`
   - `AssignedRoute` (Foreign Key referencing Bus Routes)
   - `CurrentLocation` (a reference to Bus Stops)

5. **Bus Attendance Table**:
   - `AttendanceID` (Primary Key)
   - `BusID` (Foreign Key referencing School Buses)
   - `Date`
   - `StudentsOnBoard` (a list of students or a count)
   - `AbsentStudents` (a list of absent students or a count)

6. **GPS Location History Table**:
   - `LocationID` (Primary Key)
   - `BusID` (Foreign Key referencing School Buses)
   - `Timestamp`
   - `Latitude`
   - `Longitude`

These tables and fields will allow you to manage and track school bus scheduling, routes, attendance, and real-time location information. You can extend and customize this schema to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, you'll need to implement appropriate logic in your application to interact with and update these tables as buses are scheduled, routes are managed, students board or leave buses, and location data is collected.
