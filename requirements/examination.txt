To manage examinations and results in a school management system, you would need a well-structured database that includes tables and fields to store relevant information. Here are some of the key tables and their associated fields that you might consider:

1. **Examinations Table**:
   - `exam_id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each examination.
   - `exam_name`: The name or title of the examination.
   - `exam_date`: The date on which the examination is conducted.
   - `course_id` (Foreign Key): A reference to the course for which the examination is conducted.
   - `teacher_id` (Foreign Key): The teacher responsible for conducting and grading the examination.
   - `description`: A brief description or instructions for the examination.

2. **Subjects Table**:
   - `subject_id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each subject.
   - `subject_name`: The name of the subject.

3. **Courses Table**:
   - `course_id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each course.
   - `course_name`: The name of the course.
   - `start_date` and `end_date`: The duration of the course.

4. **Students Table**:
   - `student_id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each student.
   - `student_name`: The name of the student.
   - `date_of_birth`: The student's date of birth.

   - `lower_limit` and `upper_limit`: The range of marks associated with each grade.

These tables should provide a foundation for managing examinations and results within the school management system. Depending on your specific requirements, you might also consider additional tables and fields to handle special cases, such as retake exams, practical assessments, and more.






It's essential to design your database schema carefully to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and scalability. Additionally, consider implementing appropriate relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) between these tables to represent the connections between data entities accurately.
