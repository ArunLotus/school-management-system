It's important to design your database schema to meet the specific needs of your school management system. You may also consider additional fields or customize field names based on your school's unique requirements. Database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server are commonly used for storing student information. Additionally, you may want to enforce data validation rules, foreign key constraints, and indexing to ensure data integrity and improve query performance.
